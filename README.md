Arising is the first web3-powered role-play community and experience. Through community participation and character creation, all players can create fantastic stories and moments through the world of Etia.

Etia is a fantasy world in which all characters take part. A world with four big continents full of different races, cities, conflicts, mysteries, and more. Each character has a background, an ethnicity, a purpose, and definitively a story to tell.
